Additional information:
My "Dash Graph" program is a project that I created between semesters.
This software allows you to manipulate, filter, group and present data in many different ways (Graphs, boxplots, scatter, density and more!)
In addition, you can save the filtered data(CSV or XLSX) and the figures you've created.
The main advantage of my application is that it is very accessible and straightforward even for those who aren't as experienced with working around data frames, tables, and charts. Moreover, The design is very modern and sleek.

(Small feature for the night owls: The software also contains a Dark/Day Mode for client customization)

Built with: Python, PyQt5, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Numpy.
